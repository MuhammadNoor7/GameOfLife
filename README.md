# Introduction
This C++ program simulates the "Game of Life" created by John Conway. It allows the user to initialize a grid with living and dead cells, then observes how these cells evolve over a series of generations based on predefined rules. The game runs until the user decides to exit, providing an engaging way to visualize cellular automata dynamics.

#  Explanation
The program begins with the start function, which serves as the entry point after main. This function displays a menu using Print_Menu and captures the user's choice through the User_Choice function. If the user opts to start the game, they are prompted to enter a file name for saving the initial configuration. The program then calls reading_file to handle file operations, where it writes the number of generations and coordinates to the file and reads them back for confirmation.

The Makegrid function initializes the grid by setting all cells to zero, indicating that all cells are initially dead. The UpdateGrid function updates the grid based on the user-provided coordinates, setting specified cells to one (alive). This function also displays the initial state of the grid, helping users visualize the starting configuration.

Next, the program iteratively updates the grid for the specified number of generations. The Copycells function applies the rules of the game to determine which cells live or die in the next generation. This function uses the countS function to count live neighbors for each cell. If a cell has fewer than two live neighbors, it dies (underpopulation). If it has two or three live neighbors, it continues to live, and if it has more than three live neighbors, it dies (overpopulation). New cells are born if an empty position has exactly three live neighbors (reproduction).

The Neighbours function handles dead cells' state updates by counting their live neighbors using the countL function. This function helps determine whether a dead cell should come to life in the next generation based on its neighboring live cells.

The transform function syncs the secondary array back to the main grid by copying the updated cell states. It prints the active cells, showing which cells are alive after each generation. The Clear function resets the neighbor array size to zero, ensuring the array is ready for the next iteration.

Overall, this program provides a comprehensive simulation of the Game of Life, allowing users to see how simple rules can lead to complex patterns and behaviors over time. The combination of file handling, grid updates, and neighbor counting functions demonstrates effective use of C++ for simulating cellular automata.
